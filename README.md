When you drop a building a minion leaves your base. The building will be done once it reached the blue print. If the minion gets killed before, the blue print disappears.

- Tower: Shoot units 3x3
- Barrack: Hire units on its lane
- Lab: Unlock research
- Farm: Produce food for population or gold

## Resources
Population per turn is definied by food production (farms or tech)
You can adjust the repartition of the production from farms to city (population) or gold (trade). Research of stock market increases gold from farms. Buidling a market place increase gold percentage per turn.

## Map
Same style than Plants vs Zombies. Units are moving on their own lane.
Building are placed on tiles.

## Units production
Units require population and gold.
You need to build a Barrack on each lane you want to hire units to fight.

# Roadrage helmet recorder
A helmet with a camera that starts recording as soon as you clip the jugular.
Connects to your wifi and uploads on youtube when you get home.
Maybe a bit of ML to automatically extract "interesting" parts.
